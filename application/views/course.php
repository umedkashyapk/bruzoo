                <p style="text-align: justify;">At Bruzoo, our top priority is to give free education to all students from all over the world. We have tie-ups with numerous schools &amp; Universities in India and around the world.<br>
                We do not take fees from anyone, so we take the test of children who are meritorious and children who crack the exam with their talent, we bear the entire cost of their studies like school fees, copybook, a bag of the children. And at the same time, we also give scholarships to the children for their bright future. This test has a very nominal fee, which is negligible.<br>
                We give the best education of high quality to the children and that's why we have a group of the best teachers who are very experienced who understand how to teach the children so that they understand the subject from the core.
